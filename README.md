This is my attempt at the 'Tea Cozy' project on Codecademy. 

I started programming a few months ago, and just recently got into building websites and using HTML, CSS, and JS.
Any help or tips are more than appreciated! I am trying to develop somewhat of a portfolio, and for now, this is what I am going to use. 
When I ge better, so will the projects. 

Thanks for reading! 
Connor
